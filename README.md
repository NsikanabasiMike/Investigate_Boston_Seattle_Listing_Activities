### Project Motivation
The purpose of this project is to gain insights from data using data analytics/ data science skills.
In this project, I used Seattle Airbnb and Boston Airbnb data to understand:

Which city has a higher frequent (modal) price for home-stay?
How does room type affect the price?
Does Accommodate(number of people for a room) for each room type affect the price?
What is the most used room type?
What is the most used room type based on the number of people it can accommodate?
What are the top contributors to price?

### File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
In the notebook, markdown cells were used to assist in 
walking through the thought process for individual steps.
